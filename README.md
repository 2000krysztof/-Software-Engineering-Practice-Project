# Project Name
StudySphere

# Project Vision
FOR students in universities WHO want to switch from Slack or Discord because Slack has become a paid service and Discord has a file size limit THE StudySphere IS A communication service THAT has no forced subscription and higher file size limits. 
UNLIKE Slack, Discord and Zoom OUR PRODUCT will have interactive lectures that could replace zoom calls during situations like covid. A collaborative notes section where students and lecturers can share notes amongst each other. StudySphere will also have a task scheduler where students and lecturers can plan tasks that need to be completed in a specific time frame.

# Features
Account Management:
Users can create/delete an account.
Universities/Colleges can register on Studysphere, allowing them to create accounts for students and lecturers, or register existing accounts as a member of said university/college. 
This allows universities/colleges to verify that a lecturer’s account is real, and that they work for that university/college.

Basic User abilities:
Users are able to post messages for other users to see.
Users can view messages from other users.
Users can directly message other users in the same channel.
Users cannot directly message other users who don’t share any channels with them, however, DMs (direct messages) are stored on the channel, allowing the admin of the channel to access messages between users, making channels easier to moderate.
Users can upload files up to 5GB.
Users are able to create/delete a channel.
Users have a built-in calendar that they can mark important dates/times on.
Channels can also have a calendar that can have important dates/times marked.
Will have robust voice/video sharing call functionality, ideal for giving lectures.
Set so only specific people can unmute at certain times.
This feature can be turned off at will by the lecturer during lectures to allow students to ask questions.
Can automatically record video calls to easily archive lectures, and automatically add them to the academic resource library (discussed later in unique features).


User Permissions/Channel Settings:
Able to set permissions on a channel, such as making lecturers moderators etc.
Moderator permissions allow the use of moderation tools - banning etc.
Able to add/remove plugins to channels as a moderator.
Plugins can be added to customise the functionality of channels, if users want extra functionality that is not included in the base software.
Users can join/be invited to channels.
Channels can be set to different privacy permissions, depending on the aim of the channel.
Setting the channel to “public” will allow any user to join without an invitation.
Setting the channel to “private” will only allow invited users to join. Good for channels for individual classes.
Setting the channel to “members only” will only allow users associated with the channel’s selected universities/colleges to join. Good for channels for university-wide clubs.

Other Unique features:
Each channel will come with an academic resource library that can be used for uploading files to share with other users on the channel, which can be subdivided into different categories (similar to a smaller built-in version of Moodle)
For example, categories for assignment/lab submissions, others for lecture notes/videos.
Permissions can be set for who can see the uploaded files, max file size uploaded per user and who can upload files in the first place.
Supports many different file types.

Subscription features:
Messages will always remain on channels forever, even without a subscription, as opposed to disappearing in 90 days like on the free version of Slack.
This will convince users to switch from Slack, as this is a common complaint from lecturers/universities using Slack.
Users can subscribe for additional features for all their channels
This will be much cheaper than Slack’s expensive €8.75 per user each month minimum subscription fee, making it affordable for universities that are not willing to pay as much as businesses (Slack’s main target demographic) for a communication service.
Subscribing allows more data to be stored on academic resource libraries, going from 20GB to 100GB.

This list of features was derived from matching the features that Slack and Discord provide, alongside adding extra features to set us apart from them.

# User Scenarios
Joe’s scenario:
Joe will be out sick for two weeks and needs to teach his classes online during that timespan. He wants to put up online work for his classes for the first week, but he predicts he will be well enough to conduct online lectures in the second week.

He feels that using a combination of StudySphere and Moodle would likely work well enough for the first week, but he needs the work on StudySphere to stay up for at least a semester, as he wants to be able to look over every students’ work and attendance at the end of the semester. The final submissions and attendance for classes will be made on Moodle for this, but questions, answers and smaller submissions will be shared on StudySphere.

He would use StudySphere for online lectures, as StudySphere’s strong moderation tools allow him to monitor and control students, to make sure they are paying attention. He wants to only allow students who have their cameras on to join the lectures. He also wants the students to be able to interact with lectures at certain intervals, such as the ability to ask questions, or hold small interactive quizzes similar to an app like Kahoot!.


Emma’s Scenario
Emma had no way of getting to lectures due to the cancellation of all buses due to storm Fergus. This wasn't a problem unique to Emma; many of her peers were in the same predicament, facing the prospect of falling behind in their coursework. Consequently, she would have fallen behind in her studies if she didn’t have access to her lecturers’ notes on StudySphere. Her lecturer, Mary, then decided to release her notes on StudySphere in order for students who couldn’t attend her lectures to still be able to participate.

Furthermore, Mary then also decided to use StudySphere’s online video collaboration to host optional online classes for students. Emma discerned that learning should not be monolithic and that taking classes online as well as on campus lectures is a quintessential blend of academic learning. 

For one of Emma’s assignments she has been given the task of filming a mini-documentary on a historical site in her village. It is mandatory for this documentary to be filmed in high definition. Therefore, the file size is over three gigabytes. Using StudySphere’s online upload system which has a maximum upload size of five gigabytes she successfully uploaded her assignment. This file would have been too large to upload to Slack or Discord.



Sarah’s scenario
Sarah has been having trouble with Moodle and some of her materials were not showing up for the students. Sarah was still using the Moodle submission boxes as they were explained to her by a colleague. Also the messages that were sent to Sarah from the students were coming from different sources. 

Sarah found the easy login system with the single click of the button log in with Google very convenient. She also found that sending messages into the different channels and having a centralised place for discussion very useful. She likes the idea of letting the students discuss the material and give her direct feedback if something is missing.

After using StudySphere Sarah has decided to use it for all the module material and communication. She has also decided to keep using Moodle for the work submission from the students as that is what she is used to and she does not want to relearn that.

David’s Scenario:
David has a group project that has to be completed for his programming module soon. He needs a user experience which compliments his necessity for larger file sizes. 

David finds a far smoother experience regarding educational content via StudySphere, which provides  a centralised course experience via a smooth UI that works across all platforms. 
He found StudySphere to be a robust communication platform with fantastic integrated academic resources and elite quality task management. 

David was able to format all of his schoolwork via StudySphere’s channel system, hence creating a compact yet organised system which leads towards ideal performance for top level education.
With a subscription he would in addition be able to upload files up to 100GB, hence outperforming all of the competition regarding capabilities and performance.

David found StudySphere so convenient that after using it he decided that it would in fact be a fundamental replacement in his arsenal of applications that when applied assist in pursuing his educational goals.
